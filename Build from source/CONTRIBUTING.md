## Contributing to the FLIP Fluids addon

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the **FLIP Fluids** addon for Blender. This document will detail guidelines for how you may contribute to this project.

### Using the Issue Tracker

The **FLIP Fluids** issue tracker is meant for submitting bugs/issues that you encounter within the addon. The issue tracker may only be used for reporting bugs/issues found within versions of the addon that have been distributed on the [Blender Market](https://www.blendermarket.com/products/flipfluids).

Before submitting a bug report, please read our [**Guidelines for Reporting Bugs and Issues Document**](https://github.com/rlguy/Blender-FLIP-Fluids/wiki/Guidelines-for-Reporting-Bugs-and-Issues).

Feature requests, scene troubleshooting help, questions, or comments will not be accepted on this issue tracker unless first approved by us through the Blender Market messaging system. See our document on [**Technical Support Guidelines**](https://github.com/rlguy/Blender-FLIP-Fluids/wiki/Technical-Support-Guidelines) for how to make these types of support requests.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests will not be accepted for this repository. The **FLIP Fluids** addon is developed in our team's own private repository. Due to licensing restrictions, the project source contained in this public repository does not contain the full feature set of the addon and will often not be up-to-date with the private development repository.
