# Flip-Fluids-Builds-Blender-
Here are the built from source add-ons of Flip Fluids for Blender

# How to
Go to the Builds folder and download the correct version for your computer (32 or 64 bit)

Open Blender > User Preferences > Addons > Install from Zip > Click on the .zip File > Enable the Addon

Since FLIP fluids only works on GPU, you will have to check GPU then click on your prefered one. After that you should be able to bake. If you have you can message me on Reddit as I am more likely to check that.
